# About
Uplift modeling, also known as incremental modeling is a predictive modeling technique that directly models the incremental impact of a treatment (such as a direct marketing action) on an individualâ€™s behavior.<br/>
The aim of the project was to predict customer's conversion rate, increase in the IRR (Incremental Response Rate)and given the details of a customer, predict if he falls into the persuadable category or not. Our final Incremental Response Rate(IRR) value is 10.66% on the validation set.
